# Hello, World!

This is an attempt to revive an old site of mine that has long since died. I miss all the fun I had with satire. It's time to come back.

The old site was focused on "science". Things like the effacacy of medicinal marijuana for pediatric use, or a GMO tomato crop attacking the scientists that bred them.

All good things come to an end. It was too expensive to host a wordpress site for me, at the time. I tried to use ads and merchandise to grow the site and make it profitable, but that was beyond my abilities.

Now, I have the time, knowledge, skills, and time to try again.

## New look, new focus

The old site had a scope that was too narrow. It's time to widen it up.

I like what the Babylon Bee is doing. I need to do something similar, but with my own focus and flair.

Sure, there will be satire for current science and tech news. But this needs some focus on current events, politics, and more.

It's been a long time coming, but here we are.

We're back, baby!
